# Google Cloud Dark Theme

**Unofficial Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Chrome Extension for Dark Mode**

The **Google Cloud Dark Theme** Chrome extension brings dark mode to the
Google Cloud Console. While an official dark theme has long been anticipated,
it is yet to be introduced. This extension leverages existing CSS classes and
makes minor adjustments to HTML attributes to enable a functional dark theme
for the GCP Console.

Although this extension doesn't provide complete dark theme support (e.g.,
some assets like images remain unchanged), it covers approximately 95% of
the console, delivering a visually pleasing dark mode experience for most users.

## Features

- Enables a dark theme for the majority of the GCP Console interface.
- Improves usability during extended sessions or in low-light environments.
- Easy-to-install and lightweight extension.
